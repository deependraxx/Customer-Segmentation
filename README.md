# Customer Segmentation Project

This project involves performing customer segmentation using a dataset of mall customers. The aim is to identify patterns in customer behavior and segment them based on features like age, annual income, and spending score. The project includes various data preprocessing techniques, model building (linear and logistic regression), and visualization of results.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation by analyzing their demographics and purchasing behavior. The analysis includes:
- Data import and preprocessing
- Outlier detection and removal
- Model building using linear and logistic regression
- Visualization of customer data and model outcomes
- Evaluation of the model's performance

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a mall customer dataset, which contains the following columns:
- `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `Gender`: Gender of the customer
- `Age`: Age of the customer
- `Annual Income (k$)`: Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars
- `Spending Score (1-100)`: Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** The dataset was cleaned by removing any missing values.
- **Categorical Encoding:** The 'Gender' column was converted to numerical values using Label Encoding.
- **Outlier Detection and Removal:** Outliers were identified using the IQR method and removed to ensure the quality of the data.
- **Feature Scaling:** The features `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, and `Spending Score (1-100)` were scaled using StandardScaler for better model performance.
- **Dropping CustomerID:** The `CustomerID` column was dropped as it does not contribute to the predictive model.

## Model Building
### 1. **Linear Regression:**
   - **Objective:** Predict `Spending Score (1-100)` based on `Age`, `Annual Income (k$)`, and `Gender`.
   - **Model Performance:** Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - **Objective:** Classify customers into two categories based on whether their spending score is above or below the average.
   - **Model Performance:** Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix.

## Model Evaluation
- **Linear Regression:** Achieved an MSE of approximately 0.72, indicating a moderate fit to the data.
- **Logistic Regression:** Achieved an accuracy of approximately 75%, indicating decent performance in classifying customers.

## Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot:** Visualized the relationship between `Age` and `Spending Score`.
- **Correlation Heatmap:** Displayed correlations among different features.
- **Boxplot:** Used to visualize the distribution of `Annual Income (k$)` after outlier removal.

## Conclusion
The customer segmentation project effectively identified patterns in customer behavior. The analysis highlights that while age has some influence on spending score, other factors like income and gender also play a role. The models provide a good starting point for predicting customer spending patterns, but further refinement could improve accuracy.
